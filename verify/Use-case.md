Demo / Use-case example:

This link demonstrates a concrete use case of the FXL Turbo engine producing and consuming a deterministic binary memory (mind.bin).

It is a demonstration of deterministic state production and recall, not the full Terra Dourada Oracle pipeline.

The core property shown is that the same inputs always generate the same binary state and similarity results.
