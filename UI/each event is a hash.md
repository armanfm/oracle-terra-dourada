## Event Boundary & Integrity Model

Terra Dourada does **not** perform segmented hashing, frame analysis, or stream aggregation.

Each event is treated as a **closed, atomic capture**.

### Canonical Rule

- One capture session → one event
- One event → one deterministic hash
- If capture stops, the event ends
- A new capture always produces a new hash

There is no concept of “continuation” or “partial validation”.

If a person:
- stops recording
- pauses filming
- edits the content
- trims the media
- recompresses the file

the original hash **no longer matches**.

This immediately proves that the presented content is **not the same event**.

## Why This Design Is Intentional

Terra Dourada prioritizes **clarity and mathematical finality** over complexity.

By hashing the **entire captured content as a single unit**:

- integrity guarantees are absolute
- verification is trivial and fast
- falsification is immediately detectable
- no ambiguous interpretation is possible

There is no need for:
- frame-level hashing
- Merkle trees
- streaming proofs
- partial verification modes

Any modification — of any kind — changes the hash.

## Practical Implication

If someone claims continuity after stopping a recording:

That is **not the same event**.

They must produce:
- a new capture
- a new hash
- a new event

The system does not attempt to “merge” reality.

It records **what was captured**, exactly as it was captured.

## What This System Does Not Claim

Terra Dourada does not attempt to prove whether an image, video, or artifact represents objective reality,
nor whether it was generated by a human or an AI.

Its guarantee is strictly stronger and simpler:

the content has not been modified since the moment it was registered,
and its existence at that point in time is cryptographically provable.

Truth is not asserted by trust or interpretation,
but by immutability and temporal anteriority.
