Terra Dourada integrates with Amadeus as a verified truth source.
Local sovereign verification finalizes events and publishes commitments (hash + CID).
These commitments can be consumed by Amadeus agents or on-chain logic for coordination and settlement.
No WASM execution is implemented in this submission; the design remains compatible with future deterministic runtimes.
