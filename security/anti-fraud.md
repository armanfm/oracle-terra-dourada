## Fraud Model and Explicit Limitations

Terra Dourada addresses fraud by **eliminating post-event manipulation**, not by asserting factual truth of the physical world.

### What Terra Dourada Prevents
- post-collection data editing or adjustment  
- delayed insertion and selective omission  
- reordering of events after they occur  
- batch withholding and aggregation-based manipulation  
- silent mutation or retroactive correction  
- censorship enabled by waiting for consensus  

Once an event is sealed locally, any attempt to alter, delay, or suppress it becomes **detectable and auditable**.

### What Terra Dourada Does NOT Prevent
- incorrect or malicious sensor readings  
- human error at data collection time  
- compromised hardware or firmware  
- false input deliberately provided at the source  
- lack of witnesses at the moment of collection  

### Core Guarantee
Terra Dourada does not guarantee that recorded data is *true*.  
It guarantees that recorded data **cannot be silently changed, erased, or rewritten afterward**.

Fraud is transformed from *editing reality later* into *coordinating false data at the exact moment of occurrence*, which is significantly more difficult and costly.

### Scope Clarification
- Terra Dourada verifies **integrity and provenance**, not intent or correctness  
- interpretation, judgment, and enforcement are external to the system  
- the ledger records **facts that passed deterministic verification**, not opinions  

This model ensures that disputes focus on **what happened and how it was recorded**, rather than **who should be trusted afterward**.
