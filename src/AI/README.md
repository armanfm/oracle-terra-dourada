# Terra-Dourada-Fractal-GPT

Terra Dourada is a deterministic semantic memory engine that performs recall **without embeddings** or external recall models.  
It combines structural similarity, token semantics, redundancy control, and sovereign hashing to produce **auditable, reproducible** results.

This project focuses on **identity preservation**, **semantic stability**, and **transparent reasoning**, avoiding probabilistic black-box recall.

---

## What is Terra Dourada?

Terra Dourada is **not** a generative model.

It is a **semantic recall engine** designed to:
- store meaning deterministically
- retrieve relevant context without guessing
- preserve identity and structure across long interactions

Generative models (LLMs) can be layered on top, but **recall is sovereign**.

---

## How it works

1. Text is ingested into a semantic memory store.
2. Each entry is indexed deterministically (no embeddings).
3. Recall uses a multi-stage semantic funnel:
   - token focus extraction
   - informational token weighting
   - fast prefilters (cheap → expensive)
   - structural similarity (bytes / hash / base64)
   - redundancy filtering (Jaccard)
4. Results are ranked deterministically and reproducibly.

Given the same input and memory, the output is **always the same**.

## Getting started

### Requirements
- Rust (stable)
- Cargo

### Build
~~~bash
cargo build --release
~~~

### Run (example)
~~~bash
cargo run --release
~~~

> The current implementation exposes the semantic recall engine as a Rust library.  
> You can integrate it into your own applications or build a CLI / server on top of it.

## LLM integration (optional)

Terra Dourada does **not** require an API key to perform semantic recall.

However, when layered with a generative model (e.g. Gemini or other LLMs), an API key is required **only for response fluency and text rendering**.

In this setup:
- recall remains deterministic and local
- the LLM does not decide meaning or ranking
- the LLM is used solely to improve readability and coherence

Without an API key, the system still functions correctly, returning raw recall results.

---

## Training pipeline (implemented, instant semantic training)

The training + ingestion pipeline is **already implemented**.

A key differentiator is that **semantic training is instantaneous**: new text can be incorporated into memory immediately, without waiting for embedding jobs or long training cycles.

What remains is deployment as a separate service (deployment target: Fly.io), so training can run remotely while recall stays local and deterministic.

This separation is intentional:
- training can scale independently
- recall remains fast, offline-capable, and reproducible
- inference does not depend on remote services

---

## Design principles

- **No embeddings**
- **No probabilistic recall**
- **No opaque ranking**
- **Deterministic by default**
- **Auditable and reproducible**
- **Identity-aware via stable recall**
- **Instant semantic training**

---

## Why it matters

Terra Dourada is designed to preserve **semantic identity** instead of generating answers by probability alone.

Because recall is deterministic and auditable, the system can:
- preserve identity and conceptual consistency across long interactions
- avoid semantic drift and hallucinated meaning
- support structured study, research, and knowledge consolidation
- enable reproducible reasoning instead of probabilistic guessing
- operate in a sovereign way, without external dependency for recall

This makes Terra Dourada suitable for:
- study and learning systems
- research notes and knowledge bases
- identity-aware assistants
- environments that require transparency and auditability

---

## Project status

This project is experimental and under active development.

Thresholds, heuristics, and APIs may evolve, but the core principles of deterministic recall and semantic sovereignty are stable.

## 🧠 Sovereign Training (mind.bin)

Terra Dourada provides a **public deterministic training service** responsible for generating auditable `mind.bin` files from raw text.

This training is **not a prompt** and **does not rely on generative models** to create memory.  
It produces a sovereign semantic base that can be loaded locally or accessed via API.

### 🔗 Public training endpoint
https://terra-dourada-gpt-green-butterfly-3484.fly.dev/

### 📦 What this service does
- Accepts raw text input
- Executes the deterministic training pipeline (FXL Turbo)
- Generates a `mind.bin` file
- Returns a `.zip` archive containing:
  - `mind.bin`
  - `report.txt` (training log)

### ⚠️ Important notes
- The service is **stateless** (each training job is isolated)
- The generated `mind.bin` belongs exclusively to the user who created it
- The training endpoint is exposed for **technical demonstration and validation**
- The internal training logic is part of the Terra Dourada core system

- ## 🟡 Terra Dourada — Fractal GPT

**Terra Dourada Fractal GPT** is a **deterministic artificial intelligence system** built on **explicit semantic memory**, with no weights, no opaque embeddings, and no probabilistic learning.

Knowledge is constructed through **canonical declarations** and controlled semantic variations, resulting in a fully auditable, reproducible, and verifiable model.

🔹 Not an LLM  
🔹 No global statistics  
🔹 No hallucinations  
🔹 Every response is traceable to memory (`mind.bin`)

🌐 **Public demo**:
